## What are "barks"?

Quoting from [writeraccess.com][barks]:

> Barks are a part of video game writing lexicon that refer to short lines of dialog yelled in the background. They can be totally random or in response to something that the player does. Barks are quick one-liners dictated by NPCs (non player characters) with the intent to provide additional atmospheric effects that compound quality music and/or sound design.

For example, in a first-person shooter, barks might include a soldier shouting "Argh, I'm hit!" when they take damage.

**At Subtale, we expand the scope of barks to include any dialog that is not from the game's screenplay. This includes the aforementioned examples, but also one-off, short dialog lines such as tutorial narration.**
